# TrainTicketPrediction
The dataset contains Train Ticket booking information of all 3225 tickets taken from 2016 to 2018.
We must build a train ticket confirmation chances model. We can see the charting status in the datasheet, that is the output.
Confirmed or not can be obtained from column charting status. If that contains WL or W/L the it is in waitlist.
